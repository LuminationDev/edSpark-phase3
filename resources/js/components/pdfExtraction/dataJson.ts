Preferably, they have been able to view cells under a microscope in the lab. If not, make sure to watch a relevant video. Suggested videos: Microscope View of Plant Cells (0:31)Mitosis in an animal cell Under the Microscope(0:31)Familiarity with the use of VR devices (HHVR and/or IMVR).For Session 2, students should have the following if they’re building a digital 3D model...Basic CoSpaces building skills for AR/VR experiences. Make sure to allocate 1 to 2 lessons to introduce CoSpaces if students have no background with the tool. Basic Tinkercad building skills for creating additional 3D assets. Otherwise, allocate at least 1 lesson to introduce Tinkercad skills.CoSpaces accounts (Free or Paid)Tinkercad accounts (Free)If students are building a physical model, they should have access to materials like paper mache, plasticine, clay, plastic bricks (Lego), foam craft balls, or edible materials (e.g., cake, fruits, etc).Additional Preparations for Teachers Make sure that HHVR and/or IMVR devices have the necessary apps and videos installed. Teachers should watch the videos and/or test the VR apps/games in advance to make sure that they are appropriate for their respective classes and devices.  Make sure all devices are fully charged and set-up appropriately before the lesson, with all apps installed and working.Download and distribute copies of the 1 - Cells In Focus - Student Digital Notebook  to students via email or a learning management system."
