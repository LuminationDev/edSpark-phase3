Completed the <placeholder link for 4 - AR Planning Sheet> in conjunction with selecting their historical figures.If completing the AR experience - Some background in creating in CoSpaces (and Merge Cubes, if choosing this option). Otherwise, please add 1 to 2 lessons to introduce this skill.If completing the physical model - Access to relevant materials, such as cardboard and printer.Additional preparations for teachers Check the following -For session 1:Download a copy of the following teaching resources:<placeholder link for 4 - Teaching Deck>‘Think Puzzle Explore’ template via Canva  <placeholder link for 4 - Task Sheet>Students have access to the Think Puzzle Explore’ template via Canva  and <placeholder link for 4 - Task Sheet>. These resources may be printed or distributed digitally via email or the school’s learning management system.Make sure the Merge Object Viewer app is downloaded and installed on the school’s mobile devices / iPads (available via Google Play or Apple App Store). Each device will need to be individually logged in using your preferred account.Make sure to launch the apps and check that the Ancient Egypt* and The Museum Collection* resources are loading properly. If the app doesn’t work, please check if the app has been added to the school’s whitelist. For session 2:Recommended apps are installed and working on all devices.All students have the required logins to CoSpaces.To use the Merge Cubes experience, make sure students have access to an adequate amount. Ideally, 1 cube per student**, however 2 to 3 students may be able to share 1. There is a non-Merge Cube option, so this is optional.*NOTE: Merge Object Viewer resources are accessible either in 3D format (no Merge Cubes required) or in Cube format (with Merge Cubes). You and your students will need an active internet connection on the devices to view the resources.**If you do not have access to an adequate number of Merge Cubes, you can download the following resource and create your own paper Merge Cube: Merge Cube (PDF)"
