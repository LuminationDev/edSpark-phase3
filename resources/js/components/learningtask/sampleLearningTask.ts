Make sure to label each part and describe the function of the cell parts. They can use any drawing app like MS Paint or they can use traditional media (paper, pencils, etc). Teachers may opt to make this into a science drawing competition.</li><li>Station 4: IMVR Station (Optional) - If your school has access to immersive virtual reality (IMVR) headsets or a Lumination Learning Lab, you can get students who complete their tasks to go on the IMVR station and launch experiences such as  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1308470/Journey_to_the_Centre_of_the_Cell/">Journey To The Centre of the Cell</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/451980/The_Body_VR_Journey_Inside_a_Cell/">The Body VR: Journey Inside a Cell</a>. If using this as part of the rotation, students can pair up and take turns to view the experiences and add their reflections on the student digital notebook. </li></ul><p>If you’re using the <strong>three </strong>suggested stations, students can spend approximately 10 minutes per station. If you’re using the fourth optional station as part of the rotation, consider adding an extra lesson for this learning task to make sure all students get a turn on all the stations. If you decide not to use Station 3 as part of the rotation, students can spend longer on each station.</p><p>If proceeding to Session 2, get students to think about their AR/VR experiences and their earlier brainstorming session and tell students that they will be creating a 3D cell model using either digital or physical methods.  </p><p><strong>Session 2: (60 to 90 mins)</strong></p><ol><li>Teachers can show some student examples of their cell illustrations and/or organise a ‘learning walk’ where students get to look at everyone’s illustrations. </li><li>Tell students that in this lesson, they can turn their 2D illustrations of cells into a 3D model. If building using physical tools, give students access to these tools. If building using a digital platform like CoSpaces and/or Tinkercad, give students some reminders on what you would like to see in their models (e.g., labels, interactive elements, etc).</li><li>Allow students time to build their 3D models.
